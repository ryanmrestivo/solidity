# (Not So) Smart Contracts

This repository contains examples of common Algorand smart contract vulnerabilities, including code from real smart contracts. Use Not So Smart Contracts to learn about Algorand vulnerabilities, as a reference when performing security reviews, and as a benchmark for security and analysis tools.

## Features

Each _Not So Smart Contract_ includes a standard set of information:

* Description of the vulnerability type
* Attack scenarios to exploit the vulnerability
* Recommendations to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability
* Real-world contracts that exhibit the flaw
* References to third-party resources with more information
