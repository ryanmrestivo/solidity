# Broken MetaCoin Truffle and Manticore Example

This example is the same `MetaCoin` project used in the Truffle
documentation and tutorials, however, we have added common Solidity
errors to the code, including some that are quite subtle.

A [`run_etheno.sh`](run_etheno.sh) script is provided to give some
examples of how one might use Etheno and Manticore to automatically
discover the bugs in this project.
